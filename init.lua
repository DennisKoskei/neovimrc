-- [[ NOTE: SOMETHING TO REMIND MYSELF 
--  
--  1. Vim/Neovim was meant to be a lightweight terminal text editor.
--      Do not try to make it a combination of a lot of things
--
--  2. The goal of the cofig file is to have as few plugins as possible
--      and yet achieve the desired functionaligy. Don't install unecessary
--      plugins.
--  
--  3. Do not frequently configure your config files.
--      Let your daily usage determine what you want to optimize.
--
--  4. Configure your config file at least each 6 months to a year.
--      The purpose is to let you do ***"THE THING"*** and not let 
--      tools hinder you from doing it. --> FOCUS ON CREATING
