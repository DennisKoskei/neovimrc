1. Telescope - for fuzzy finding files and more.
1. Neo-tree - navigating through my directories.
1. Monokai-Pro - theme/colourscheme.

1. nvim-web-devicons - for mono fonts and icons.
1. LSP Confgurations
   - lspconfig
   - nvim-cmp
1. gitsigns -
1. Other small plugins such as:
   - lualine
   - mini.lua
   - undotree
   - zen-mode
   - speedtyper
   - lazydev
   - indent_blankline

## **Getting Started**

0. Ensure you have Neovim installed

1. Go to your cofig directory which may look like `~./config/` on linux or `C:/User/Appdata/` on windows.

2. In that directory, create a directory called `nvim`, and cd into it.

3. **Clone the repository**. This will copy the repository to your current `nvim` directory.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DennisKoskei/neovimrc.git .
   ```
4. **Restart nvim**. You'll see the basic configuration trying to setup itself. Give it a few seconds to download all the necessary configuration files.
