# My Neovim config

This repo contains my personal Neovimconfiguration. Feel free to use, adapt, and contirubet to it!. I've tried to make it as moduler and easy as possible to navigate through the files.

2. Neo-tree - navigating through my directories.
3. Monokai-Pro - theme/colourscheme.
4. Nvim-treesitter - 
5. nvim-web-devicons - for mono fonts and icons.
6. LSP Confgurations
    - nvim-lspconfig
    - nvim-cmp
7. gitsigns - 
8. Lazy.nvim - My Plugin Manager
9. Other small plugins such as:
    - lualine
    - mini.lua
    - undotree
    - zen-mode
    - speedtyper
    - lazydev
    - indent_blankline

## **Getting Started**
0. Ensure you have Neovim installed

1. Go to your cofig directory which may look like `~./config/` on linux or `C:/User/Appdata/` on windows.

2. In that directory, created a directory called `nvim`, and cd into it.

1. **Clone the repository**. This will copy the repository to your current `nvim` directory.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DennisKoskei/neovimrc.git .
    ```
2. **Restart nvim**. You'll see the basic configuration trying to setup itself. Give it a few seconds to download all the necessary configuration files.
